# History

This is a basic history of our world. This is mostly to get a general sense of the events that drive the world to what it is. This will also set the rules we need for history.

## Rules

In order to create a culture, here are the basic rules (somewhat arbitrary).

* First, read what you can about worldbuilding. It's important. It makes even bad stories more compelling. People can discover the history for themselves.
* The bigger the importance of the culture, the more history is required. Don't fret the details, though. You need room for stories to breathe.
* A good rule of thumb: Main Game Culture, you need 500 years of history. Single Digit Side Quests Culture, you can get away with a couple decades of history.
* Do not reveal everything all at once, or really ever. History isn't always given to you on a silver platter.
* Speaking of reveal, the longer back your history goes, the more fuzzy it should be in the present. 500 years ago should feel like tall tales and exaggerated stories. Yesterday should feel like fact.
* Timelines are a great way to organize your thoughts and you should use them (maybe even reveal them for important cultures) but remember that no story is truly linear.
* Cross referencing other events that happen at the same time in history makes the culture more compelling.
* Big events should be there: wars, political upheaval, religious, mystical. But, do not forget small things. Helen of Troy is memorable because she was the "Face that launched a Thousand Ships", not because she actually fought in the Trojan War.
* Acknowledge but don't embrace sexism, racism, homophobia, etc. unless it's a key part of the plot. Default to egalitarian stories and use these negative aspects of humanity in interesting ways. No, Amazon princesses isn't interesting. Fight the tropes!

## Deep History

from 100,000 years ago to 500 years ago...

The world was young and born into being from a cosmic event billions of years before. The world (we'll call it Gaea for now, but should have a better name) formed and life evolved many times over. Time and time again life began, was brought to the brink of extinction, and fought its way back. Around 100,000 years ago, that struggle may have finally been won by evolution. Simultaneously, many humanoid races emerged from our distant ancestors. They brought with them consciousness -- the ability to recognize the self and to reflect. And, with that consciousness came another evolutionary leap: magic. Consciousness and magic rapidly changed the world. Empires grew and fell. The races began to change the world around them.

We think that from 100,000 years ago to about 5,000 years ago, there may have been as many as 30 humanoid races that all possessed consciousness and magic. Today, there are 4 primary races with "lower humanoid" creatures numbering in the hundreds. These are races that possess limited magic and limited consciousness. We aren't sure exactly what happened to the other races, but we think they went extinct either through absorption into another race or outright extermination.

Religion was born. Gods were born and created so fast that no one today can keep track of how many there were. Mystics and star reading became normal, fell out of favor and came back again. Mythical beasts were created in the minds of the races, most likely stemming from the lower humanoids. There are still researchers looking for the elusive creatures of history, believing them to be real but undiscovered.

Civilizations started to form and people began to understand their magic. Before, it was used for primal means such as starting fires. But now with cities and professions, people could investigate the depths of their own mind. From the investigation into magic, arts and more professions sprung up. Potters, cartwrights, blacksmiths, etc. all came into their own. Mystics and star reading became magicians and witches. Eventually, more applications of magic and arts came into being. Enchantment and gemsetting were discovered. High magic and mages started coming into their own. And adventurism became a skill in its own right.

There is no major external threat on our world. Nations and civilizations have come and gone. Some get too greedy and over extend themselves. Some get too complacent and fall to the wayside. Others get absorbed and some break apart. Race wars exist. Alliances have always shifted and there doesn't seem to be one superior race over another, despite many claims. Gods are present and if you listen to the priests, the true source of magical power is those gods. City-states and nations both pop up. The one constant seems to be technological progress. The world seems to continue to march forward despite the best efforts of the four races to destroy it all.

## Four Races

* Humans
* Elves
* Halflings
* Giants

## Brief History of Cragfall

The name cragfall comes from both an event and the keep that takes after its name. About 400 years ago, a large slice of the mountain range now named the Crags slid away. The mountain seemed to have split in two and created a massive landslide that diverted rivers, sent shockwaves across many leagues and killed thousands of people. It was a tragedy and people living in the area fled to the plains to the west, seeking refuge from the villainous mountain.

After 300 years ago, a clan of giants moved below the foothills created by the landslide. The mountain still looked carved neatly in half, with a vertical side that seemed to stretch into the sky endlessly. It took nearly 60 years, but the giant clan created a keep built into the side of this vertical mountain. They called it Kluldhor. Here they set up and from the safety of the keep started to create an empire. They first stretched out to conquer the scattered tribes on the western plains and then moved north upriver. They conquered most of what is today called Constantia. Around 150 years ago, they started moving downriver. Following the river down to the swamps, they were mired in a literal quagmire for years. It was a stalemate between the giants and the forced alliance of halflings and elves (and humans, though they were more of a resistance from the western plains). The Alliance of the Three Races was unable to push forward, nor flank the giants. This war lasted until around 80 years ago.

That was when the halflings researched and discovered how to float. This seemingly whimisical magic was transformed by Maris Dorkrana. Maris was the Commander of the Three Races and was a half-elf (See Appendix I for more information about Maris Dorkrana). He was able to discern that the floating spell would allow the troops to move freely through the swamp and attack with great speed and precision. Armed with this new capability, the Alliance was able to outmaneuver the Giants and push them back inch by inch. After breaking through the swamp, the Alliance harried the Giants all the way back to Kluldhor. A siege commenced.

The siege lasted years and the giants were effectly starved out. They were desperately attempting to research new magic or skills that would allow them to rout the Alliance, but to no avail. 70 years after the war had begun, it was finally over. The alliance took all of Constantia and divided the lands. The north was given to the elves. The west to the humans. The south to the halflings. And, finally, the city now called Cragfall that surrounded Cragfall Keep became a shared prefecture between the three monarchs of the human, elves, and halflings.

For the next 50 years, Cragfall was in constant uprising. As soon as the amicable alliance was disbanded, the three races were fighting with each other. At first it started with verbal territorial disputes. The halflings claimed that more of the west should have gone to them for their contributions. After all, it was halfling magic that finally broke the war. Humans claimed it was their land, had always been their land and that it was rightfully theirs. They took it to be settled by the three monarchs at a special council in Cragfall. The three monarchs, Queen Polynomise of the Halflings, King Hemm Huldreik of the Humans, and King Edwyrd Raloris of the Elves, met and came to an agreement that would place the disputed land in a special status where both humans and halflings would have the ability to settle, but the humans would be in charge.

That didn't last long. A few years later, King Huldreik died. He was succeeded by his eldest daughter Brigette. Queen Brigette Huldreik was highly affected by a radical movement called the Knights of Cragfall. The Knights believed that all of Cragfall belonged to them by divine right. That the fall of the crag was a challenge from the gods. The Queen, from a young age, was deeply involved with the movement and emerged as its vocal leader after her coronation. Her knights started to raid halflings in the neutral zone, enforcing new laws that were transparently being created to push the halflings out.

Another special council was called. This time, though, no peace was to be brokered. During the council itself, the Knights attempted to take the city of Cragfall. Hundreds of people died in the failed coup. The Queen managed to escape. The damage was done and the city became ground zero for political intrigue, assassinations, and resistance movements. Curfews were established and the city underwent something similar to martial law for nearly 50 years.

Then, Johamma showed up on the scene. She began as an idealist in the local city council and quickly gathered support. She railed against the status quo, placing blame of the cities problems on distant monarchs that ruled with an iron fist. Growing in popularity amongst the populace, Johamma ran for Tribune. The Tribune in Cragfall was the people's spokesperson. They could enact city bylaws and had a voice at any council meetings of the monarchs. Merely a symbolic post in the past, Johamma was quick to consolidate power and stretch the limits of her new position. She spoke at every city council meeting, bringing in new bylaws that started small but grew bolder each time. She was a crowd pleaser. Her bylaws reduced sentencing and penalties for violating curfew laws, required that the police act with respect toward fellow citizens, put together a citizen's council that could propose new bylaws to the city council. More and more and more Johamma pressed the limits of her role. Finally, she went too far according to the monarchs. Johamma lifted the ban on Giants, welcoming them into the city. It was magnanimous, but it was also political. Giants were a neutral but strong third party. They had no love for the three monarchs and Johamma enticed them to join as enforcers of the Tribune's will. They became her bodyguards but also the guards of the people against the oppressor. The curfew was effectively lifted, taxes going to the 3 nations were abolished, and citizens of Cragfall experienced more freedom in their lives than they ever had before.

A final special council meeting was held. The monarchs and Johamma faced off in a small council chamber that now sits inside the Great Forum. A long and spirited debate followed with many threats from the monarchs. But, in the end, Johamma was more bold than they ever deemed possible. Tribune Johamma declared Cragfall an independent city-state, free from the influences of the three monarchs and left to rule its own. It also would become a citizen open to all races and would build into its charter the principles of democracy. The Tribune would be a democratically elected leader of the city, living in the defunct Cragfall Keep and keeping watch over the citizens of Cragfall.

The monarchs were livid. Less about losing Cragfall and more about the insult created. They planned to take siege to Cragfall, but the Alliance that was to be formed again fell apart when Queen Huldreik and Queen Polynomise couldn't agree on terms. They disagreed about the final administration of Cragfall. And, so, unable to broker a peace between the other races, King Raloris pulled his support for the siege and it fell to the wayside.

Tribune Johamma was elected twice more to 5 year terms, and died of natural causes about 5 years ago. She is still considered a hero to the citizens of Cragfall. Since becoming independent, Cragfall has experienced a burst of economic and cultural growth. Population has boomed, being the only city that accepts all races to live within its borders. However, due to the influx, the citizens of Cragfall are becoming more and more strict about who they allow to become citizens. There is a large portion of the population that would prefer not to accept any more new citizens, thinking that the city is crowded enough. Still, many non-citizens choose to be a part of the city because of the relative amount of freedom they can experience.
